# 🔐 Offline Password Manager (C++)

A simple, secure, and offline command-line password manager built in C++.  
Allows users to sign up with a master password and store their credentials locally in an encrypted vault.

---

## ✨ Features

- ✅ **User Signup & Login**

  - Secure authentication using a master password
  - All passwords are hashed before storage (XOR-based in v0.1)

- ✅ **Per-User Vault System**

  - Each user has their own vault file: `vault_<username>.db`
  - Files are stored locally in `data/` (and ignored from Git)

- ✅ **Add New Entries**

  - Store site name, username, password, and optional notes
  - Passwords are encrypted before being saved

- ✅ **View Entries**

  - See all stored entries (with decrypted password display)

- ✅ **Search Entries**

  - Find saved credentials by website name

- ✅ **Update Existing Entries**

  - Modify stored credentials (site, user, password, notes)

- ✅ **Delete Entries**

  - Remove entries from vault cleanly

- ✅ **Organized Codebase**
  - Separated into modules (`auth`, `vault`, `utils`)
  - Header files and shell build script included

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 🔧 Build (Linux/macOS)

```bash
chmod +x build.sh
./build.sh
```

▶️ Run

```bash
./build/password-manager
```

### ⚠️ Notes

XOR encryption is used for simplicity (not secure in production)

In future versions: switch to AES (Crypto++) + stronger password hashing (e.g., SHA-256 or bcrypt)

This is an evolving project: clean commits coming as features are added

### 📌 Status

✅ MVP complete  
🛠️ Ongoing development (CLI polish, stronger encryption, etc.)  
🎯 Focused on clarity, modularity, and security principles
